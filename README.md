      <h3 style="color: hsl(241, 100%, 89%);">Your Result</h3>
      <div id="circle">
        <p style="font-size: 50px; padding:0px;">76<span style="color: hsl(241, 93%, 84%); padding: 0px; font-size: 15px; ">of 100</span></p>
      </div>
      <p id="g">Great</p>
      <p id="p5">You scored higher than 65% of the people who have taken these tests.</p>
    </div>
```
```css
.card1
{
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
    place-content: center;
    height: 400px;
    width: 275px;
